# Heart disease Prediction using Naïve Bayes classifier

In this example we are using the **Naïve Bayes** classifier to solve a popular example of classification problems, which is **_Whether a person has a heart disease or not_**.

- #### Dataset
To solve this problem we need an **_Initial data_** to **train** and also **test** the model we gonna create, and for that reason we used this dataset from Kaggle.com : [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

- #### Steps 
	1- Download data from the source.
	<br>
	2- **Import** the **data** and study its **structure, description, observations**.
	<br>
	3- Visualize **missing data**.
	<br>
	4- **General visualizations** on data to understand more the relation between its parameters.
	<br>
	5- Split the data into **_Training data_** and **_Testing data_**.
	<br>
	6- Create **_Naïve Bayes Classifier_** and train it with **_Training data_**.
	<br>
	7- **Test the model** classification with the **_Testing data_**.
	<br>
	8- **Evalute** the prediction results with **_Confusion Matrix_**.

- #### What is Naïve Bayes ?
**Naïve Bayes Classifier** is Considered is one of the most popular models that are used to solve classification problems, and it considered one of the top efficient and accurate classifiers.
