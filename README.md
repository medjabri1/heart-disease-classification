# Heart disease classification using Naive Bayes classifier

In this example we are using the **Na誰ve Bayes** classifier to solve a an example of classifications problem, which is **_Whether a person has a heart disease or not_**.

- #### Dataset
To solve this problem we need an **_Initial data_** to **train** and also **test** the model we gonna create, and for that reason we used this dataset from Kaggle.com : [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

- #### Steps 
	1. Download data from the source.
	2. **Import** the **data** and study its **structure, description, observations**.
	3. Visualize **missing data**.
	4. **General visualizations** on data to understand more the relation between its parameters.
	5. Split the data into **_Training data_** and **_Testing data_**.
	6. Create **_Na誰ve Bayes Classifier_** and train it with **_Training data_**.
	7. **Test the model** classification with the **_Testing data_**.
	8. **Evalute** the prediction results with **_Confusion Matrix_**.
			 

- #### What is Na誰ve Bayes ?
**Na誰ve Bayes Classifier** is Considered is one of the most popular models that are used to solve classification problems, and it considered one of the top efficient and accurate classifiers.
